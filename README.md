Hey there! I’m Mahdi, a software developer.
I’m interested in building web apps, GNU/Linux, and teaching / tutoring (both coding and non-coding things!). Good team player and a self-learner. Very interested in seeing and experiencing new environments and technologies .

You can reach me on the https://link.sudoit.ir/
